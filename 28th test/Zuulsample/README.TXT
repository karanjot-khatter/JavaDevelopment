This project is a further enhancement of zuul-with-beamer.
This version can now have locked doors which can be unlocked by the correct 
key.
The player can pick up and drop items. 
There is a maximum weight that the player can carry.
If the player eats a magic cookie the maximum weight the player can carry is
increased.
If the user has not reached the Computing Admin. within 6 moves the game is terminated.
The user has a beamer. When you charge a beamer it memorizes the current room. 
When you fire the beamer, it transports you immediately back to the room it was
charged in.
There are doors between the rooms and some of them are locked. If you are lucky you can
find a key to unlock a locked door.
